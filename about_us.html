      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>Dignans Catering is a high quality outside catering company based in Edinburgh. We have been established for five years and work from a café/brasserie which is the other side of our business.</p>
        <h2>Our Services</h2>
        <p>We provide catering services to local businesses and offices in the immediate area surrounding the café, as well as one-off clients requiring services like celebration buffets. Our menus are always crafted with fresh and locally sourced ingredients to provide the highest quality food for your event.</p>
        <p>We have regular customers and several contracts for catering, often through word of mouth recommendations from previous customers. However, we are looking to expand our business further afield within the Edinburgh district into office lunches, corporate catering, corporate barbeques, etc and target a wider customer base in and around Edinburgh.</p>
        <h2>Our Website</h2>
        <p>We have decided that a website would be a great way forward to expand our business. The website could be advertised on our van and in the numerous local online business directories. We would like an attractive, friendly website that conjures up delicious food. On the website we display all our menus, along with a print option. We would like potential customers to be able to find the website by using a search engine. The company would like customers to be able to order simple and/or repeat catering requirements by e-mail. This would require the customers to register their details before being allowed to order using this method. The owners of the company would like to advertise special offers that would change monthly.</p>
        <p>Our basic logo can be found on our printed menus, but we are willing to review this in order to have an attractive website that suits our purposes.</p>
